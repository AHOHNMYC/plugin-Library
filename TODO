= TODO =

for general items, see doc/todo.txt

apart from that, dotted throughout the source code are the following:

- URGENT bugs will likely crop up until this issue is fixed
- FIXME
- PRIORITY major things, that other things depend on
- TODO
- OPTIMISE

- DOCUMENT
- DEBUG - was added for debug, should be removed
- WORKAROUND - workaround an external bug (eg. freenet, java itself, etc.)

there are also methods or code blocks containing:

throw new UnsupportedOperationException("not implemented");

== New tags ==

I've started to use the following system. The old tags will eventually be
changed to this format.

tag : X Y, where

X is the type, currently out of FIX TODO OPT
Y is the priority, currently out of NOW HIGH NORM LOW

This covers all cases from the old set and more, except for DOCUMENT and DEBUG
which will still be used.
