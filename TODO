= TODO =

FOR GENERAL ITEMS SEE doc/todo.txt

there are also methods or code blocks containing:

	throw new UnsupportedOperationException("not implemented");

apart from that, dotted throughout the source code are various tags:

== "Work" tags ==

tag : X Y, where

X is the type, currently out of
	- FIXME: known error, or lack of error handling
	- TODO: refactoring, or additional feature
	- OPT: optimisation
Y is the priority, currently out of
	- NOW: current work
	- HIGH: do it soon
	- NORM: plan to do it eventually
	- LOW: nice idea, but not necessary

There are still some "TODO" tags without a priority tag.

== Misc tags ==

- DOCUMENT
- DEBUG - was added for debug, should be removed
- WORKAROUND - workaround an external bug (eg. freenet, java itself, etc.)
