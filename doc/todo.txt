put @Override on everything

index: "suggested tokens" - suggest what other people should tag this index as;
       they are free to ignore this suggestion



- implement de/inflate(k) for STM and SPTM


- have a Skeleton<K> interface with deflate(K) methods so that

SkeletonMap<K, V> extends Skeleton<K>
GhostTreeSet extends Skeleton<Integer> (or int[]?)


- implement GhostTreeMap (for SortedMap<FreenetURI, URIEntry>)

same as GhostTreeSet below, but with keys instead of indexes
also, the map can be modified (since add/rem key does not change the keys
of the other entries)


- implement GhostTreeSet (for SortedSet<TokenEntry>):

keeps two lists of the same length:
int[] partitionIndex (start index of element in each partition)
boolean[] partitionLoaded (whether the element has been loaded)

iterator will go through these arrays and throw an exception when it
encounters an unloaded element.

the set cannot be modified or toArray()'d unless it is live

with deflate(Index)
