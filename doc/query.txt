= Query =

== Purpose ==

Code to perform queries on the network of indexes

mikeb is doing this part...

== Search algorithm for a single index ==

This algorithm is for when URIEntry and filter support is added to the spider
and the query interface; atm it is unimplementable.

- parse index root
- parse filters

something like:

site A: result 1 [site data]
 - site A: result 2 [site data]
 - (show more results from this site)
site B: result 1 [site data]
site C: result 1 [site data]
site D: result 1 (click to retrieve site data)

in the meantime, keep pulling URIEntry data in the background, and update the
page as necessary.

Results are ordered by relevance^3 * quality. If the URIEntry has not been
loaded yet, we assume the quality is 0.9.
