           Crawler -------> Library -------> QueryGUI


Library:
 - to put/get the data to/fr freenet
 - exposes this functionality to other packages/plugins through FCP (or whatever)
   - allowing you to do stuff like
   - GET [LibraryEntry] [QueryString]
   - PUT [LibraryEntry] \n\n [Data]s
   - etc etc
 ! TODO: index format: internal data structure, freenet data structure
 ! TODO: FCP interface commands

Crawler
 - crawls freenet based on user configuration settings
   ! TODO decide what these settings should be
 - PUT the data into a Catalog for the ID
 - SAVE the Catalog to freenet

Interdex
 - gets a list of IDs from WoT
 - LOAD and GET data from these IDs
 - combine them into a single Catalog
 - PUT the data into a dummy Catalog

QueryGUI
 - GET data from a Catalog
 - QueryGUI could be just part of Library?
